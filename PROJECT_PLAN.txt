COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT:
- feat: Add [feature name]
- fix: Fix [bug description]
- style: Update [component] styling
- refactor: Refactor [code section]
- test: Add tests for [feature]

TESTING APPROACH:
- Test each feature immediately after building
- Don't move to next task until current one works
- Use browser console for debugging
- Check Supabase database for data integrity


================================================================================
NOTES & TIPS
================================================================================

🎯 FOCUS AREAS:
- User experience - make everything intuitive
- Visual feedback - users should know what's happening
- Error handling - never crash, always inform
- Performance - fast loading, smooth animations

🚀 QUICK WINS:
- Start with bills management (most important)
- Get one complete feature working before moving to next
- Use existing components (Button, Input, Card, Modal)
- Copy patterns from similar features

⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS:
- Not validating form inputs
- Forgetting to handle loading/error states
- Not testing with empty data
- Skipping mobile testing
- Not handling currency conversion

💡 BEST PRACTICES:
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic to hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types (if migrating)
- Add PropTypes for components
- Comment complex calculations
- Keep service files separate from components
